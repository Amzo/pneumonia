## Repository
The repository of the project contains cnnModels.ipynb, pneumoniaDetect.py, README.md, gui files, as well as files with our missions. 

The first cnnModels.ipnyb file is the most important file of our project, the notebook where the project either trained or loaded 4 additional models ontop of our model that we have created. 

pneumoniaDetect.py file is a copied GUI over.  

README.md file, which helps to provide all neccessary information about the project and files.
